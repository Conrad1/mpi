RUNNING the program

FILES: 
MultiProcessParams.txt (ENGLISH) ItalianMultiProcessParams.txt GermanMultiProcessParams.txt
Takes 2 numbers at the start -- the number of processes (Remember to include 1 extra for the master) and the number of files you want run at the same time 
The next line(s) are :
Number of Processes, word file, tag for output name, and parameter file

If you want to test everything before running it on the server, try
mpiexec -n [processes] zornet

To run on the server, type
qsub zornet2.job (or whaterver the job name is).

The mpi directory needs to be changed to where it is.

Be careful of DRC_OS. Some things will crash the UNIX mode (try taking out all the fprintf stuff
